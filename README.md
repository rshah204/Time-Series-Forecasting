Time Series and Forecasting Project
----------------

Forecasting number of International Passengers Flying to USA via foreign carriers over a month using the methods of time series modeling. 

• Formulated an adequate non-linear time series model in RStudio for prediction of International passengers flying to USA via foreign carriers over a month.

• Data set comprised of 148 data points which was divided into Training Set and Testing Set.

• Adequately modeled deterministic part with a polynomial growth trend of order 3 in addition to a periodic trend with dominant period of 12 months along with some harmonics of periods 6, 4, 3 and 2.4 months.

• Adequately modeled stochastic part (stationary series) with an ARMA(2,2) model.

• Performed joint optimization of deterministic and stochastic part to formulate the final integrated model.

• Predictions tested using the integrated model resulted in a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of only ~8%.
